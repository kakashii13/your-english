# Future Continuous

We use the future continuous to talk about an action in the future that overlaps another,
shorter action or a time. The action in the future continuous usually starts before and
might continue after the second action or time. This is very similar to how we use the past
continuous in the past. The verb after ‘when’ is usually in the present simple.

```
- I'll be waiting when you arrive.
- At eight o'clock, I'll be eating dinner.
```

We can use the future continuous to talk about something that will happen if everything
happens as we expect. This is sometimes called ‘future as a matter of course’. It’s usually
possible to choose the future simple as well, but we often choose the future continuous
because then it’s clear that we are not making a request or offer.

```
- The Government will be making a statement later.
- When will you be leaving?
```

:::info
Remember, we can’t use the future continuous with stative verbs, so if we want to use a
stative verb in one of the situations where we need to the future continuous, then we use
the future simple with ‘will’.
