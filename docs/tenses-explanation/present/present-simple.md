# Present Simple

## Present Uses

We use the present simple when something is generally or always true.

```
- People need food.
- It snows in winter here.
- Two and two make four.
```

Similarly, we need to use this tense for a situation that we think is more or less
permanent. (See the present continuous for temporary situations.)

```
- Where do you live?
- She works in a bank.
- I don't like mushrooms.
```

The next use is for habits or things that we do regularly. We often use adverbs of
frequency (such as ‘often’, ‘always’ and ‘sometimes’) in this case, as well as expressions like
‘every Sunday’ or ‘twice a month’. (See the present continuous for new, temporary
or annoying habits).

```
- Do you smoke?
- I play tennis every Tuesday.
- I don't travel very often.
```

We can also use the present simple for short actions that are happening now. The
actions are so short that they are finished almost as soon as you’ve said the sentence. This
is often used with sports commentary.

```
- He takes the ball, he runs down the wing, and he scores!
```

## Future Uses

We use the present simple to talk about the future when we are discussing a timetable or a
fixed plan. Usually, the timetable is fixed by an organisation, not by us.

```
- School begins at nine tomorrow.
- What time does the film start?
- The plane doesn't arrive at seven, it arrives at seven thirty.
```

We also use the present simple to talk about the future after words like ' 'when', 'until',
'after', 'before' and 'as soon as'. These are sometimes called subordinate clauses of time.

```
- I will call you when I have time. (Not 'will have'.)
- I won't go out until it stops raining.
- I'm going to make dinner after I watch the news.
```

## Conditional Uses

We use the present simple in the first and the zero conditionals.

```
- If it rains, we won’t come.
- If you heat water to 100 degrees, it boils.
```
